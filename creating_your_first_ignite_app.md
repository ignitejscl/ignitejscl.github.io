# Creating your Ignite Application

Let's create a simple project with ignite, first make a new directory for the project and change into that directory:

```
mkdir hello_world_project && cd hello_world_project/
```

Now, let's run ```ignite init``` and fill out some basic information...

```shell
ignite init
```

You'll be asked to fill out a few simple questions, here's the questions and sample answers:

```
? What's your name? Michael
? What is the project's name? ignite_helloworld_example
? What's the version number? 0.0.1
? What's the project about? This is a sample project for Ignite to get using Ignite
? Package dependencies? Seperated by commas (,). Ex: chalk,express chalk,express,ora
? Git Repository Link https://github.com/ignitejs/helloworld_example
? What file will be the start file? Ex. index.js index.js
? Use Docker? (y/n) n
? Create Dockerfile? (y/n) n
```

Once completed, you will get a response like this:

```
✔ Created configuration file.
✔ Saved configuration file
```

If you're interested to see how it's compiled, check the ```.ignite-config.js``` file, it should look something liket his:

```javascript
/** ------ Generated by Ignite ------ */
/**
 * @name ignite_helloworld_example
 * @version 0.0.1
 * @author Michael
 * @description This is a sample project for Ignite to get using Ignite
 */
 module.exports = {
     name: "ignite_helloworld_example",
     version: "0.0.1",
     author: "Michael",
     description: "This is a sample project for Ignite to get using Ignite",
     dependencies: ["chalk","express","ora"],
     git: "https://github.com/ignitejs/helloworld_example",
     scripts: {
         "test": "exit 0",
         "start": "node index.js"
     },
     config: {
         use_docker: false,
         create_dockerfile: false,
         dockerfile: false
     }
 }
```

Now, if we want to install this, just run:

```
ignite install
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
Ignite: Installing project dependencies for you now!

✔ Wrote package.json file
✔ Installed dependencies successfully.
Installed chalk successfully
Installed ora successfully
Installed express successfully
```

Now, if you list the contents in the directory you'll see everything is installed.

Now, let's make a simple express server to share, make a file called index.js and in there put:

```javascript
/** 
 * Hello, world! - Sample Project for Ignite.js
 */

const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const chalk = require('chalk')
const ora = require('ora')
const port = process.env.PORT || 8080

let spinner = ora("Starting server...").start()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
	console.log(chalk.bold("GET /"));
	res.send("Hello, world! - Ignite.js sample project");
})

app.listen(port, () => {
	ora.succeed("Started server on port " + port);
	console.log(chalk.bold(":)"))
})
```

This code we just put above will create a simple express server, and listen on port 8080 or what the ENV is set as for PORT. We also use Ora to create give simplie indication we're making the server, it provides a little spinner for us to use. Once we listen on the server port, we'll output the port and a smiley face.
