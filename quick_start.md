# Installing Ignite

Installing Ignite is super easy and quick, you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed first. Once you install NodeJS and NPM (included with NodeJS on most systems), open the terminal (on windows, command prompt) and type:

```shell
npm install ignitejs -g
```

That's it! Ignite is now installed, and you're off to a great start already.
