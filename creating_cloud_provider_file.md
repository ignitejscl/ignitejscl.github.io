# Creating a cloud provider file

Want to deploy to a different cloud provider, but don't have a provider file? You can create one by running ```ignite create-provider``` - you will be prompted for a few simple questions, much like the ignite init command. Here's the questions with sample answers:

```
? What's your name? Michael
? What is the provider's name? my-example-provider
? What's the version number? 0.0.1
? What's this provider file do? You can now deploy to my example provider!
? Package dependencies? Seperated by commas (,). Ex: chalk,express chalk,ora
? Git Repository Link https://github.com/ignitejscl/ignite-provider-example
? What file will be the main file? Ex. index.js index.js
```

You should now see the following output:

```
✔ Created configuration file.
✔ Saved configuration file
✔ Generated file successfully.
```

If you're curious to how the ignite-provider-config looks like, it should match something similar to this:

```javascript
/** ------ Generated by Ignite ------ */
/**
 * @name my-example-provider
 * @version 0.0.1
 * @author Michael
 * @description You can now deploy to my example provider!
 */
 module.exports = {
     name: "my-example-provider",
     version: "0.0.1",
     author: "Michael",
     description: "You can now deploy to my example provider!",
     git: "https://github.com/ignitejscl/ignite-provider-example",
     start: "index.js",
     dependencies: ["chalk","ora"]
 }
```

Now, we can open up the index.js file and in our ```exports.run``` we will write our code to deploy, a simple example is provided, this file looks like so:

```javascript
/** ----- Generated by Ignite ----- */
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

exports.run = () => {
    let sampleCommand = spawn('whoami')
    sampleCommand.on('exit', (code, signal) => {
        if(code === 0) {
            console.log('Successfully ran whoami');
        }
        else {
            console.error('Failed to run whoami');
        }
    })
}
```

If we want to share this provider, we can use the same ```ignite share``` command, and it will bundle everything up.
