## Sharing your project

Now that we've made a configuration file, we can create all the code we need, and then run ```ignite share```

You'll get output similar to:

```

Ignite: Let's generate a share file and readme to distribute

âœ” Created tar stream, and saved as 'ignite-bundle.tar'
Now you can distribute your friends the ignite-bundle.tar and they just need to run: npm install ignitejs && ignite install to get everything started
```

Now, all your important files, including the ignite configuration file are bundled up, you can put this anywhere you want, and extract it, then run ```ignite install``` again.
